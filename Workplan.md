# MNXB11 -Team work plan 

**Someone wants to order a pizza but can't be bothered to leave their house.**
*They look up "pizza nearby" and looks for the phone number of the first place that pops up.*
#The pizza gets ordered by phone, is rung up by the cashier, and comes through on the kitchen ticket.

So first of all, obviously, we need to have a dough ball to flatten. 
Luckily, the overnight crew have already prepared BATCHES of dough. 
Then, we need the sauce and the cheese (maybe some olives?).
Call me crazy, but the pizza needs a shower of oregano aswell. 
Also, we forbid pineapple.
